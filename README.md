# HighOrderPaths
Text representation with Higher-Order Paths


This project aims to represent these higher-order paths by using Linked-Lists.
Consequently, this project is a programming assignment in C, which aims to build an
algorithm based on linked-lists that will build an efficient representation of documents.
